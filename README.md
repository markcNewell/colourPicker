# colourPicker

A small application that when run waits till the right mouse button is clicked, when that event occurs the mouse's x and y position is recorded and the pixel colour underneath the mouse in taken.

To build/run the project it is required that you add the JNativeHook libary to the project. (https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook)
As far as I'm aware this is already included within the project so it should work straight off here. If not this is most easily done through Maven.
